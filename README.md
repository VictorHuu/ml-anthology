# Study Record of Machine Learning

This repository is organized as a monorepo for systematic study and practice in machine learning.

## Courses

- **CS229** – Mathematical foundations of machine learning, with an emphasis on replication and research training (poster, slides, oral presentation, and paper writing).  
  Reinforcement Learning is not covered in this course; related concepts are studied via [Cornell CS4780](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/syllabus/).  
  Course materials: [CS229 Resources](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229)

- **EE364a** – Mathematical foundations of optimization and convex analysis.  
  Lectures **11–13** and **15–17** are intentionally skipped, as they are less relevant to an AI/ML-oriented curriculum.

- **CS224N** – Implementation-focused course on deep learning for natural language processing.

  Course materials: [CS224N Syllabus](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1246/index.html#schedule)

- **CS324** – Paper reading, critical discussion, and research-oriented analysis.
